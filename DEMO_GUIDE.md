## **‚ùì Common Questions & Answers**

**Q: "How does this integrate with Whop?"**
A: "We use Whop's webhook system to receive real-time member events. When someone cancels, schedules cancellation, or has payment issues, we automatically get notified and take action."

**Q: "What if someone doesn't fill out the survey?"**
A: "That's fine - we still track the cancellation and can see patterns. The survey is just one piece of data. We also track payment failures, scheduled cancellations, and member activity."

**Q: "How much does this cost?"**
A: "We're launching with a simple pricing model - $X per month per business. Given that it typically saves 1-2 members per month, it pays for itself quickly."

**Q: "Can this scale to large businesses?"**
A: "Absolutely. We built this with multi-tenancy from day one. Each business is completely isolated, and the system can handle thousands of webhook events per minute."
